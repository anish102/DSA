The solution function first checks if the length of the input array A exceeds 1,000,000,000, in which case it returns -1. Otherwise, it calls the count_inversions function to compute the number of inversions in the array.<br/><br/>
The count_inversions function uses the merge sort algorithm to divide the array into two halves, recursively count the inversions in each half, and then merge the two halves while counting the inversions between them.<br/><br/>
The merge_and_count function is responsible for merging the two halves of the array while counting the inversions between them. It does this by comparing the elements in the two halves and appending the smaller element to the merged list. If the element from the right half is smaller than the element from the left half, it means that all the remaining elements in the left half are inversions with the current element from the right half, so we add (mid - i + 1) to the inversions count.<br/><br/>
The time complexity of this solution is O(N log N), where N is the length of the input array A. This is because the merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(N log N), and the merge_and_count function takes linear time to merge the two halves and count the inversions.
